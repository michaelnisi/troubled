Your privacy is as important to me as my own. I’m a person who writes software, I have neither interest nor means to store data about you. Thus, the software I build is designed to accumulate as little data as possible. I’m committed to keeping your personal information safe. OK, that last sentence I’ve lifted from [Apple](https://apple.com), I don’t store personal information, they do that for me. I rely on Apple’s strict [policies](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/) and quality of execution.

Building iOS apps, I don’t require personal information or logins, using [iCloud](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202303) I can build personalized apps without knowing anything personal about the users of my software, except that they have an iOS device. Apple’s iCloud handles authentication for me, capsulating personal information from me, while still letting me map personalized application data to users. Note the distinction between personal data and personalized data.

Application data, like episodes or subscriptions in a podcast app, for example, is also stored, and synced across devices, using iCloud. Again, no personal information is accessible to me.

This website applies no analytics or tracking.
