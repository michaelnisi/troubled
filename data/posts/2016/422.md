CACHING IS HARD, especially if you donâ€™t have control over the data sources. [Manger](https://github.com/michaelnisi/manger), a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) program  I wrote to cache RSS feeds, encounters all kinds of things in the wildâ€”RSS over HTTP is a zooâ€”but recently it failed in a particular, mildly amusing, way.

While running an integration test, a client requested Lena Dunhamâ€™s [Women Of The Hour podcast](https://art19.com/shows/women-of-the-hour) and got nothing back, so it failed.

Hitting its cached URL manually, I got a *301*:

```sh
curl -v http://feeds.soundcloud.com/users/soundcloud:users:180603351/sounds.rss

*   Trying 93.184.220.127...
* Connected to feeds.soundcloud.com (93.184.220.127) port 80 (#0)

> Host: feeds.soundcloud.com
> User-Agent: curl/7.43.0

```

Why would my program trip over a plain *redirect*? My first suspicion was the protocol change, HTTP redirecting to HTTPS. Clearly, that shouldnâ€™t be a problem either, but it was the only somewhat interesting bit about this.

Debugging my program, I saw:

```
MANGER 23881: { headers: { 'accept-encoding': 'gzip' },
  hostname: 'feeds.soundcloud.com',
  method: 'GET',
  path: '/users/soundcloud:users:180603351/sounds.rss',
  port: 80,
  protocol: 'http:' }

```

*422*, eh? The *4xx* class encompasses client errors, but I hadnâ€™t encountered *422* yet. Apparently, it is neither part of [RFC 7231](http://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7231.html), nor listed under Status code [there](http://httpwg.org/specs/). Instead, *422* is part of [RFC 4918](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4918), a WebDAV HTTP extension.

> The 422 (Unprocessable Entity) status code means the server understands the content type of the request entity (hence a 415(Unsupported Media Type) status code is inappropriate), and the syntax of the request entity is correct (thus a 400 (Bad Request) status code is inappropriate) but was unable to process the contained instructions.  For example, this error condition may occur if an XML request body contains well-formed (i.e., syntactically correct), but semantically erroneous, XML instructions.

Someone at [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/) has a soft spot for obscure tech. WebDAV, whatâ€™s that again? *Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning*. Ah, O.K. â€¦

But what is the [SoundCloud API](https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/guide) trying to tell me? I found these [HTTP status codes](https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs#errors), including **422 Unprocessable Entity**:

> The request was valid, but one or more of the parameters looks a little screwy. Itâ€™s possible that you sent data in the wrong format. One example would be providing an array when we expected a string.

A little screwy? Come on! Whatâ€™s screwy about this request?

```js
{ headers: { 'accept-encoding': 'gzip' },
  hostname: 'feeds.soundcloud.com',
  method: 'GET',
  path: '/users/soundcloud:users:180603351/sounds.rss',
  port: 80,
  protocol: 'http:' }
```

O.K., letâ€™s compare it with curlâ€™s request:

```
> GET /users/soundcloud:users:180603351/sounds.rss HTTP/1.1
> Host: feeds.soundcloud.com
> User-Agent: curl/7.43.0
> Accept: */*
```

Comparing the two, I spotted the obvious difference in the headers. My program didnâ€™t sent User-Agent or Accept headers. My intuition led me to try the Acccept header first, because I thought that might be a thing.

```js
{ headers: { 'accept-encoding': 'gzip', accept: '*/*' }
```

*422*, still. So, headers arenâ€™t the issue. I had just updated to Node v6.7.0, there might be, although highly unlikely, something off with its HTTP moduleâ€”hopefully not. I was about to go deep with [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/), when I decided to try the User-Agent header as well.

```
MANGER 23881: { headers:
   { 'accept-encoding': 'gzip',
     accept: '*/*',
     'user-agent': 'screwy' },
  hostname: 'feeds.soundcloud.com',
  method: 'GET',
  path: '/users/soundcloud:users:180603351/sounds.rss',
  port: 80,
  protocol: 'http:' }
MANGER 23881: redirecting to https://rss.art19.com/women-of-the-hour
MANGER 23881: { headers:
   { 'accept-encoding': 'gzip',
     accept: '*/*',
     'user-agent': 'screwy' },
  hostname: 'rss.art19.com',
  method: 'GET',
  path: '/women-of-the-hour',
  port: 443,
  protocol: 'https:' }
```

ðŸŽ‰ TA-DAH! In fact, the SoundCloud API demands the HTTP user-agent header being setâ€”set to anything, really. I understand what theyâ€™re doing here, assumingly meeting a requirement of their logging, but passing *422* to a plain *GET* is, for want of a better word, *a little screwy*.
