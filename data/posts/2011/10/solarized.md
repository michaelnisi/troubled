[Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) is a sixteen color palette (eight monotones, eight accent colors) designed for use with terminal and gui applications. It has several unique properties. Ethan Schoonover designed this colorscheme with both precise [CIELAB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lab_color_space) lightness relationships and a refined set of hues based on fixed color wheel relationships.

The things with which we are surrounding us day in day out are of the utmost importance, accordingly the asthetics of a programmer's trusty editor cannot be overstated. Solarized makes you feel like coding in the shadow under a walnut tree on a bright summer's day. You can almost feel the fresh summer breeze on your skin. It is available for lots of editors, I am using it with [Vim](http://www.vim.org/), [XCode](http://developer.apple.com/xcode/) and [IntelliJ](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), which is providing the nice convenience, that all my editors have the same uplifting looks. Well, the colors at least. Give it a try, you will not look back.
