Recently, I had a chance to try GraphQL on iOS. After a quick search for a client library, I picked Apollo iOS and built [Swifters](https://github.com/michaelnisi/swifters), a little app that lists Swift users on GitHub. But its main purpose, of course, has been to compare the imperative REST approach to the declarative GraphQL way, from a client authorâ€™s perspective.

REST is procedural and if you have ever maintained an app which talks to a bunch of microservices, you know the pain. Coordinating servers and clients, even if itâ€™s the same person or team working on them, is a messâ€”eventually leading to conservatism. We develop a fear of change, there are just too many moving parts.

> REST isn't a fit for modern applicationsâ€”[Why is GraphQL important?](https://www.apollographql.com/why-graphql)

And to take the biscuit, imagine doing this with a dynamic language, server side and client side. But hey, who does that, right? Using Swift, statically typed, with traces of functional programming, we are pretty safe. But how can we safely integrate with remote APIs, so we can embrace change?

#### We need a type-safe contract between client and server

[GraphQL](https://graphql.org) is a query language for APIs, originally created at Facebook in 2012. Interacting with a GraphQL endpoint, you describe what you need in your query and get exactly that, with the resultâ€™s fields mirroring the queryâ€™s. A single GraphQL endpoint may aggregate data from many resources. Its typed schema can replace versioning, which is flimsy anyways, especially for microservicesâ€”that service of yours is what version now?

[Apollo iOS](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/) is a strongly-typed, caching GraphQL client.

There are many GraphQL [implementations](https://graphql.org/code/). For example, server-side frameworks for [JavaScript](https://graphql.org/graphql-js/) and [Erlang](https://github.com/shopgun/graphql-erlang).

You donâ€™t need a complex client to hit a GraphQL endpoint. Hereâ€™s GitHub:

```
$ curl https://api.github.com/graphql
```

Responding with:

```js
{
  "message": "This endpoint requires you to be authenticated.",
  "documentation_url": "https://developer.github.com/v3/#authentication"
}
```

After you have [created](https://developer.github.com/v4/guides/forming-calls/#authenticating-with-graphql) your OAuth token, try logging in bearing the `<token>`.

```
$ curl -H "Authorization: bearer <token>" -X POST -d " \
 { \
   \"query\": \"query { viewer { login }}\" \
 } \
" https://api.github.com/graphql
```

VoilÃ !

```js
{"data":{"viewer":{"login":"<your_github_login>"}}}
```

Exploring APIs with [curl](https://curl.haxx.se) is fun, but to actually build something, of course, you need a client. For JavaScript, there are [Relay](https://facebook.github.io/relay/), [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/), and many [more](https://graphql.org/code/#javascript-1). For [other languages](https://graphql.org/code/#graphql-clients) as well.

But letâ€™s return to aforementioned iOS application. Swifters uses [Apollo iOS](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/), a strongly typed, caching GraphQL client for native iOS apps. Our app lists [Swifters](https://github.com/michaelnisi/swifters). No, not sheep, housekeepers neither. Taylor Swift fans on [GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=swift&type=Users).

#### Making the difference

Creating adaptive UIs, collection views and table views can be used to structure apps. This requires rich data sources providing these views with data. Correctly built, with diffing and `performBatchUpdates(_:completion:)`, flexible app structures emerge.

Detailed understanding of `performBatchUpdates(_:completion:)` is essential for building this kind of apps. I recommend taking [A Tour of UICollectionView](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/225/).

Every iOS developer has implemented a diffing algorithm for updating collection views or table views, one way or another. Looking around, I like [DeepDiff](https://github.com/onmyway133/DeepDiff). In fact, I like it so much that I have  extracted its `diff` function into a single [file](https://github.com/michaelnisi/swifters/blob/master/Swifters/ds/diff.swift)â€”386 lines of code.

Iâ€™m excited about the recent [Ordered Collection Diffing](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0240-ordered-collection-diffing.md) proposal, describing additions to the Swift Standard Library that provide an interchange format for diffs as well as diffing/patching functionality for appropriate collection types.

#### Diving in

The app repo contains detailed [installation](https://github.com/michaelnisi/swifters#installation) instructions, hereâ€™s just a quick intro, independent from the app, exploring the Apollo command line tool. Letâ€™s install it with npm. In a tempdirectory, do:

```
$ npm i apollo
```

We can try it locally using [npx](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/162869356040/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner), an npm package runner.

```
$ npx apollo
```

```
Command line tool for Apollo GraphQL

VERSION
  apollo/1.9.2 darwin-x64 node-v8.12.0

USAGE
  $ apollo [COMMAND]

COMMANDS
  codegen  Generate static types for GraphQL queries. Can use the published schema in Apollo Engine or a downloaded schema.
  help     display help for apollo
  queries  Checks your GraphQL operations for compatibility with the server. Checks against the published schema in Apollo Engine.
  schema   Check a schema against the version registered in Apollo Engine.
```

Type `help` followed by a command name to explore the tool, for example:

```
$ npx apollo help schema
```

#### Schemas and Types

> A GraphQL service is created by defining types and fields on those types, then providing functions for each field on each type.

These types are defined in a schema, a contract with clients. Letâ€™s download the schema of the GitHub GraphQL API, authenticating with the OAuth token from above.

```
npx apollo schema:download --endpoint=https://api.github.com/graphql --header="Authorization: <token>"
```

And with that, we have just downloaded the 45K LOC schema file of the GitHub GraphQL API v4. ðŸ˜® Peeking into the file, we find the GitHub API Graph expressed in JSON, not for humans though, but for [machines](https://developer.github.com/v4/guides/intro-to-graphql/#discovering-the-graphql-api) to read. GraphQL is [introspective](https://graphql.org/learn/introspection/), you can ask a schema about itself. For example, this query JSON would list all GitHub types:

```json
{
  "query": "{ __schema { types { name } } }"
}
```

```
$ curl -sSH "Authorization: bearer <token>" -X POST -d '{ "query": "{ __schema { types { name } } }" }' https://api.github.com/graphql | json -ga data.__schema.types | json -ga name | wc -l
```

```
482
```

Wow, with almost 500 different types, this API is vast. âœ¨

Naturally, there are more convenient ways of exploring GraphQL. [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) lets you write, validate, and test GraphQL queries in your [browser](https://developer.github.com/v4/explorer/).

### Noted while writing the app

Here are my notes, jotted down while making the app.

#### First impressions

Reading the Apollo documentation, my main concern with Apollo iOS approach is the tight coupling between view controllers and the remote API, merging access and storage. On the other hand, [repositories](https://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/repository.html) have the same surface. Apollo wants to remove the serialization layer, which can be a millstone around the neck of developers, rendering them hesitant to change. Propagating an adjustment from the server onto the screen is often laborious and requires coordination between different teams.

But the service logic leaks into your view controllers. Is that modern? Maybe. The `schema.json` is a contract. I have to read up on GraphQL API versioning.

Apollo does not only remove serialization, but also builds a local graph. I decided to go all in for this little experiment and query from my collection view data sources, which accompanies nicely my other dogma for this demo: collection views only.

#### Three days later

Three days later, Iâ€™m impressed. After passing the intial ramp, aquiring a rudimentary understanding of GraphQL and setting up Apollo, it has been a downhill rideâ€”thrilling and fast. Building an app by modeling queries like clay is incredibly effective. Development can get pretty spontaneous that way. For large apps, of course, this may also become a problem, despite all being statically typed, which is pretty amazing by the way.

#### A week later

A week later, do I still believe in REST? I havenâ€™t experienced implementing a GraphQL serverâ€”[graphql-erlang](https://github.com/shopgun/graphql-erlang) looks fantasticâ€”but from the client perspective and what Iâ€™ve seen so far, I would recommend GraphQL. All parts fell into place quite naturally. Intuitive decisions were mostly right. My reading matter for the next couple of weeks is set. ðŸ“š

#### I have questions

- Offline first? How would we persist the graph cache?
- How does memory management of the graph work?
- Why is `GraphQLFragment` not `Hashable`?
- Whatâ€™s up with these memory leaks?
