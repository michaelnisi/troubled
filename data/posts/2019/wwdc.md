This yearâ€™s [Dub Dub](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc19/) keynote was quite a bombshell and people are firing their hot takes. I quickly want to highlight three topics: developer experience, packages, and collections.

#### Developer experience

The term functional programming is used very broadly these days. Anything is buzzing with functional programming now. If you havenâ€™t written any Haskell, you probably donâ€™t know what you are talking about. Functional programming today commonly means less state and a declarative programming model, think [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html). Tagging React *functional* is a stretch, but you get the idea. Itâ€™s a trend, testable software wins.

Building apps in a declarative way is one pillar of this yearâ€™s Dub Dub. [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift) got a sibling. [Combine](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine), a declarative Swift API for processing values over time.

React developers will get interested when they see [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/), a declarative Swift UI framework with Xcode integration, including live previews. People are excitedâ€”some not so muchâ€”Apple hit a nerve. SwiftUI is a simple way to build user interfaces across all Apple platforms. Itâ€™s a stepping stone to a unified Apple developer experience. If you have been on the fence, now is a good time to start developing for Apple platforms.

These declarative Swift APIs are enabled by [Function Builders](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/9992cf3c11c2d5e0ea20bee98657d93902d5b174/proposals/XXXX-function-builders.md), which allow you to create embedded domain-specific languages in Swift. Other parts of the puzzle are [Property Delegates](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0258-property-delegates.md) and the new custom view controller initializers.

Might be a good time read up on [Functional Swift](https://t.co/NkYwU3LE42) or watch some [videos](https://www.pointfree.co) if thatâ€™s your thing.

#### Packages

Xcode 11
Swift packages for all Apple platforms
Swift 5.1 module stability

#### Collections

Compositional Layouts + Data source diffing is here

#### Apple is on a roll

Itâ€™s great to see how Swift starts bearing fruit. Harvest time ðŸŒ½

> Less Code. Better Code. Everywhere.

Iâ€™ve not felt that inspired by Apple since the introduction of Swift. However, knowing the complexities of building *real* apps, I remain sceptical and canâ€™t wait to explore what can be build with SwiftUI. Itâ€™s all in the details. Thereâ€™s a reason why I have never considered [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).

If SwiftUI is the new way of building apps for Apple platforms, UIKit and AppKit are on their way of becoming implementation details. Without *storyboards*, the way we use Interface Builder will change.

To end, here are select things from my notes.

#### iOS

- 2x faster app launch and smaller download size
- A lovely serif, [New York](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/)
- Dark Mode
- Hundreds of system icons with [SFSymbols](https://t.co/zLSBq14fzw?amp=1)
- Multiple UI Instances
- [Core Data Sync](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata/mirroring_a_core_data_store_with_cloudkit/)

#### macOS

- Voice Control
- Z shell is default on macOS Catalina ðŸ˜Ž
- iPad apps for Mac (Project Catalyst fka Marzipan)
- iTunes exploded into three apps: Apple Music, TV, and Podcasts

#### Watch

- Stand alone apps and App Store for watch

#### More tooling

- Bug reporting with the new Feedback Assistant app
- Xcode mini map (âŒ˜ to see symbol names and jump right to them)
