Threads enable execution of multiple code paths concurrently. A lock or mutex is a construct that guards access to a critical section in your code. Granting access to only one thread at a given time prevents race conditions. A race condition is a situation where truth becomes ambigious in your program. What happens if you subtract one from two twice, at the exact same time?

[Foundation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation) provides [Thread](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/thread) and [Runloop](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/runloop) APIs, but we have better tools for mutual exlcusion control.

Mike Ash has a list of available mutex [APIs](https://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/friday-qa-2017-10-27-locks-thread-safety-and-swift-2017-edition.html). Here are the mutex constructs we use in iOS apps.

#### NSLock

Also in Foundation we find [NSLock](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nslock), which uses POSIX threads to implement locking behaviour.

#### DispatchQueue

Better than using locks is to design points of synchronization into your program. Queues are the obvious tool for organzing work. Many may be familiar with [message queues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_queue). On Apple platforms we use [Dispatch.framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/dispatch) to run code on multicore hardware. It uses dispatch queues to manages the execution of tasks serially or concurrently. *Dispatch* distributes work to threads and cores that lets us concentrate on our apps.

TODO: Explain serial queue sync locking

[DispatchQueue](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/dispatch/dispatchqueue)

For performance critical code with many reads and rare slow writes, you can go faster by using a concurrent queue to which you would submit your writing blocks with the `.barrier` flag asynchronously. This construction models a [readers-writer lock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readersâ€“writer_lock), only stalling reads during writes without corrupting ongoing reads.

ðŸ’¡ *Aside from the term being ambigious, always measure performance, never make assumptions. You are not a computer.*

If you are haunted by race conditions, donâ€™t perforate your code with locks, instead go back to the drawing board and think about the design of your software. Often times there is an elegant way out. Try to think in queues of events and tasks. Keep in mind that an [OperationQueue](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/operationqueue) can be made serial by limiting its maximum number of queued operations to one. Good apps use a creative combination of DispatchQueue and OperationQueue.

#### Avoid excessive thread creation

Unfortunately, we cannot be entirely thread-agnostic using Dispatch yet. Designing our own queues, we must avoid excessive thread creation. Never block the current thread from a task submitted to a concurrent dispatch queue, the system will create new threads to run its other tasks and eventually your app will run out of threads. Try not to use private concurrent queues, use the global concurrent queues instead. Locking with serial queues is super handy, but you might end up creating many queues. Make sure to set the target of your serial queues to one of the global concurrent queues.

#### Trust the system

I want to end with a rule of thumb for Dispatch. If you can delegate a decision to the system, do it. We are humans, we donâ€™t know shit. And always use TSan, the [ThreadSantizer](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSanitizer.html) of Xcode target Diagnosticsâ€”I never turn it off. Likewise, the Main Thread Checker.
