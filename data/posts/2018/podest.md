Promoting my new podcast app, available on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/podest/id794983364), I’m reminded of just how many podcast apps there are—now. Searching the term “podcast” in the store, I face a wall of podcast players. *I came for glory,* I shout shaking my fist, not for squeezing my hard work into these saturated shelves. Does this choir of apps, blaring their unique selling propositions, ask for another voice in its cacophony?

#### I love podcasts

Podcasts first clicked with me, when I discovered the [Stack Overflow podcast](https://stackoverflow.blog/2008/04/17/podcast-1/), back in 2008. This periodic conversation between [Joel Spolsky](https://www.joelonsoftware.com) and [Jeff Atwood](https://blog.codinghorror.com), about the progress of building their [site](https://stackoverflow.com), was an eye opener. Listening to human voices at close range, over headphones or device speakers, can create an intimate bubble, a feeling of connectedness between listener and hosts. I have fond memories—strangely enough—of long wintery walks with the dog listening to [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net) and [Dan Benjamin](http://danbenjamin.com) chatting about Apple stuff on the original [Talk Show](http://5by5.tv/talkshow), of wiping the wooden floors of my St. Georg apartment to [The Book Review](https://www.nytimes.com/column/book-review-podcast), or listening to [Pavel Mayer elucidating C++ on CRE](https://cre.fm/cre063-die-programmiersprache-c-plus-plus) in front of the fire place with my laptop on the floor.

Today, with everyone carrying a connected—playback and recording—device in their pockets, audio is big—for voice control and listening. [The Daily](https://www.nytimes.com/podcasts/the-daily) quickly became a household name during the 2016 election campaign, reaching five million unique listeners every month, [they say](https://www.recode.net/2018/2/13/17005660/new-york-times-the-daily-american-public-media-radio-podcast-michael-barbaro-lisa-tobin-code-media). Pioneers like [Radio Open Source](http://radioopensource.org), [99pi](https://99percentinvisible.org), [This American Life](https://www.thisamericanlife.org), [Radio Lab](https://www.wnycstudios.org/shows/radiolab) are still going strong.

Podcast labels—publishing and production—are a thing now: [Radiotopia](https://www.radiotopia.fm), [Wondery](https://wondery.com), [Headgum](https://headgum.com), [Gimlet](https://www.gimletmedia.com), [Pineapple Street Media](http://pineapple.fm) to name a few. I also want to mention the German studios [Viertausendhertz](https://viertausendhertz.de), [Pool Artists](http://www.poolartists.de), and [Metaebene](https://metaebene.me).

Print publications understand that podcasts bond readers with writers, deepening the connection to their brands. Not only newspapers, like [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/audio) and [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/podcasts), also magazines—[Monocle](https://monocle.com/radio/), [New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/podcast), and more recently [New York Magazine](http://nymag.com), which just premiered [The Cut on Tuesdays](https://www.thecut.com/2019/10/the-cut-on-tuesdays-podcast-episode-1-power.html), a new weekly with Gimlet—are creating splendid audio. In Germany, [Die Zeit](https://www.zeit.de/podcasts) got the memo.

Digital natives, [Slate](http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts.html), [Vox](https://www.vox.com/pages/podcasts), or [Recode](https://www.recode.net/podcasts/) and [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/podcasts), are already there.

[SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/for/podcasting), [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com), and [Deezer](https://www.deezer.com/) have integrated podcasts into their offerings. Amazon produces podcasts—for [Alexa](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa) I guess—with its audio book company [Audible](https://www.audible.com/blog/). But these products are chimera, for something to call itself a podcast, it must have a public feed, in my opinion at least.

After merely mirroring their signals into the podcast space, following early adopters like [NPR](https://www.npr.org) or [WYNC](https://www.wnyc.org), grand broadcasters like the [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts) are getting serious.

[Stitcher](https://www.stitcher.com) cultivates a collection of podcasts, an alternative to the original [iTunes](https://www.apple.com/itunes/podcasts/), being the inventor of the [iPod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod), in 2001, Apple has been among the founders of [podcast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast) land.

#### Apps are made of priorities and compromises

I have forgotten how I intitially listened, with iTunes and iPod, I think. Later, on iPhone, I began with Apple [Podcasts](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/podcasts/id525463029), and later [Downcast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/downcast/id393858566), which I used for quite some time. Then came [Instacast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/instacast-core/id108386833), which I liked, but as it turned out, didn’t scale to hundreds of subscriptions. I had to return to Apple Podcasts. I kept trying [Overcast](https://overcast.fm), but stuck with Apple Podcasts, apparently made by developers who did not listen to podcasts, at least back then.

Apps are made of priorities and compromises. From time to time, I try one of the newer apps coming out, but find them confusing. If a podcast app requires me to wade through a tutorial, something went wrong. This all goes to show, after a decade of listening, I have not found a podcast app I enjoy—here be dragons.

#### You're holding it wrong

My way of consuming podcasts might be unfit for the available apps. How do I listen to podcasts? I don’t walk the streets with headphones and I don’t have a commute. I listen at home, walking around the house, doing chors, while shaving or in bed before sleep, without headphones, using the internal device speakers—another reason why I prefer larger devices. For pausing and resuming playback and skipping I use the watch, with the phone in my pocket or placed somewhere near. I never use AirPlay or listen over the stereo. Podcasts are near-field audio for me, they are personal. When another person enters the room, I stop playback. I quit listening on walks, prefering sounds of nature, the city, or company.

Constanly trying out new podcasts, my subscriptions level around one hundred podcasts. Three of my longtime favorites are [Scriptnotes](http://scriptnotes.net), [Longform](https://longform.org/podcast), and the [New Yorker Fiction](https://www.newyorker.com/podcast/fiction) podcast.

#### What do I want

- Audio and video playback including streaming
- Use the app offline
- Clear user interface
- Good search for shows and episodes
- Informative lists leveraging landscape mode
- Browse and read show notes while playing
- Access from all my devices
- Control Center and Apple Watch controls

And what we all want, from all apps, a snappy user interface that stays of the way and a full battery.

#### Inverted approach to building it

Can I shift priorities and combine compromises in a way that lets me build a better podcast app? Probably not, such an app would exist by now, wouldn’t it?

The user interface of a podcast app is challenging, it has to communicate two narratives in parllel, information and playback. It’s different from Netflix in that way, the video app doesn’t let you browse, while you are watching. With an audio app you can be listening to one thing, while you’re looking at another—a player and a browser. Additionally, a good podcast app, while focusing on audio, must integrate video playback.

Boosting my chances for coming up with something new, I deleted all podcast apps from my devices and went to work. If I wanted to listen to podcasts, I had to build an app, that was in 2014. Apple just had announced Swift, a good time to start an app, with me as its [first customer](https://github.com/joyent/eng/blob/master/docs/index.md#rule-1-fcs-quality-all-the-time).

[![Podest](/img/podest.svg "Podest Logotype")](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/podest/id794983364)

The obvious approach would be to start with an audio player, building the app around it. Instead, to foster innovation, I decided to work on searching and browsing first, before concerning myself with playback. I’ve structured the project analogous to the application flow: searching, browsing, and playback.

In parallel I worked on parsing. Podcasts, not unlike blogs, are published as XML feeds with enclosed media files, plain references to the audio files. Quickly it became apparent that parsing on the device would not scale. You can parse a few feeds, but not hundreds. Alone the required network connection would kill the performance and the battery. I wrote two streaming parsers for the server side feed cache, I was about to build, [pickup](https://github.com/michaelnisi/pickup) for Node and [feeder](https://github.com/michaelnisi/feeder) in Erlang—not committing to a stack just yet.

Actually, when I started tinkering with this podcast app idea, the first thing I wrote was a [chapter parser](https://github.com/michaelnisi/MNAVChapters)—now used in Castro.

Podest is a simple, yet powerful podcast app. Obviously, this late in the party, I can’t compete by increasing the number of features, but I can compete in quality. It helps that Podest is all Swift—don’t @ me.

[![Podest](/img/podest_app_icon.svg "Podest App Icon")](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/podest/id794983364)

- Audio and video playback
- Powerful search
- Accessible from all your iOS devices
- Energy efficiency
- Landscape mode

Check the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/podest/id794983364) for details.

I’m in the process of open sourcing all components of this app, all the Swift and JavaScript modules get published on [GitHub](https://github.com/michaelnisi/), many parts are already there.

#### Improving internal playback controls and dark mode

Once my modest promoting the app is concluded, I will work on the internal player controls—currently the relies on Control Center for scrubbing—adding controls for scrubbing, skipping a few seconds forward, and a sleep function. After that I want to add dark mode, although iOS might be surfacing an API for it in the near future.

#### Download on the App Store

Back to the initial question. Does it make sense to build something that already exists? If you think you can improve something, of course, but even if not. If you can, you should build all the things. Diversity produces progress. Always reinvent the wheel! That’s how we learn.


**There were plenty podcast players, but no podcast browser. Try it and tell me what you think.**
