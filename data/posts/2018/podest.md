Promoting my new podcast app, available on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/podest/id794983364), I’m reminded of just how many podcast apps there are now. Searching for the term “podcast”, I face a wall of podcast players. *I came for glory,* I shout shaking my fist, before I stuff my hard work into the saturated shelves. Does this choir of apps, praising their *unique* selling propositions, really for another voice in its cacophony?

#### I love podcasts

Podcasts first clicked with me, when I discovered the [Stack Overflow podcast](https://stackoverflow.blog/2008/04/17/podcast-1/), back in 2008. This periodic conversation between [Joel Spolsky](https://www.joelonsoftware.com) and [Jeff Atwood](https://blog.codinghorror.com), about the progress of building their [site](https://stackoverflow.com), was an eye opener. Listening to human voices at close range, over headphones or device speakers, can create an intimate bubble, a feeling of connectedness between listener and hosts. I have fond memories—strangely enough—of long wintery walks with the dog listening to [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net) and [Dan Benjamin](http://danbenjamin.com) chatting about Apple stuff on the original [Talk Show](http://5by5.tv/talkshow), of wiping the wooden floors of my St. Georg apartment to [The Book Review](https://www.nytimes.com/column/book-review-podcast), or listening to [Pavel Mayer elucidating C++ on CRE](https://cre.fm/cre063-die-programmiersprache-c-plus-plus) in front of the fire place with my laptop on the floor.

Today, with all of us carrying connected audio devices in our pockets, capable of playback and recording, audio is big. Voice control. Recording. Listening. [The Daily](https://www.nytimes.com/podcasts/the-daily) promptly became a household name during the 2016 election campaign, reaching five million unique listeners every month, [they say](https://www.recode.net/2018/2/13/17005660/new-york-times-the-daily-american-public-media-radio-podcast-michael-barbaro-lisa-tobin-code-media). Pioneers like [Radio Open Source](http://radioopensource.org), [99pi](https://99percentinvisible.org), [This American Life](https://www.thisamericanlife.org), [Radio Lab](https://www.wnycstudios.org/shows/radiolab) are still going strong.

Podcast labels—publishing and production—are a thing now: [Radiotopia](https://www.radiotopia.fm), [Wondery](https://wondery.com), [Headgum](https://headgum.com), [Gimlet](https://www.gimletmedia.com), [Pineapple Street Media](http://pineapple.fm) to name a few. Residing in Germany, allow me to mention [Metaebene](https://metaebene.me), [Viertausendhertz](https://viertausendhertz.de), and [Pool Artists](http://www.poolartists.de), with the splashy [WIMAF](https://wimaf.podigee.io) podcast.

Print publications understand that podcasts bond readers with writers, deepening the connection to their brands. Not only newspapers, like [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/audio) and [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/podcasts), also magazines—[Monocle](https://monocle.com/radio/), [New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/podcast), and more recently [New York Magazine](http://nymag.com), which just premiered [The Cut on Tuesdays](https://www.thecut.com/2019/10/the-cut-on-tuesdays-podcast-episode-1-power.html), a new weekly with Gimlet—are creating splendid audio. In Germany, [Die Zeit](https://www.zeit.de/podcasts) got the memo.

Digital natives, [Slate](http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts.html), [Vox](https://www.vox.com/pages/podcasts), or [Recode](https://www.recode.net/podcasts/) and [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/podcasts), are already there.

[SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/for/podcasting), [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com), and [Deezer](https://www.deezer.com/) have integrated podcasts into their offerings. Amazon produces podcasts—for [Alexa](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa) I guess—with its audio book company [Audible](https://www.audible.com/blog/). But these products are chimera, for something to call itself a podcast, it must provide some kind of public feed, I think.

After merely mirroring their signals into the podcast space, following early adopters like [NPR](https://www.npr.org) or [WYNC](https://www.wnyc.org), grand broadcasters like the [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts) are getting serious.

[Stitcher](https://www.stitcher.com) cultivates a collection of podcasts, an alternative to the original [iTunes](https://www.apple.com/itunes/podcasts/). Apple, inventor of the [iPod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod), in 2001, was among the founders of [podcast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast) land.

I forget how I intitially listened. With iTunes and iPod, I guess,  [casually moonwalking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTwd7SaYPQg) out the door in baggy pants.

#### Apps are made of priorities and compromises

Came iPhone, of course, I began with Apple [Podcasts](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/podcasts/id525463029) and later [Downcast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/downcast/id393858566), which I used for quite some time. Then came [Instacast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/instacast-core/id108386833), which I liked, but as it turned out, didn’t scale to hundreds of subscriptions. I had to return to Apple Podcasts. I kept trying [Overcast](https://overcast.fm), but stuck with Apple Podcasts, apparently made by developers who did not listen to podcasts, at least back then.

Apps are made of priorities and compromises. From time to time, I try one of the newer apps coming out, but find them confusing. If a podcast app requires me to wade through a tutorial, something went wrong. This all goes to show, after a decade of listening, I have not found a podcast app I enjoy—here be dragons.

#### You're holding it wrong

My way of consuming podcasts might be unfit for the available apps. How do I listen to podcasts? I don’t walk the streets with headphones and I don’t have a commute. I listen at home, walking around the house, doing chors, while shaving or in bed before sleep, without headphones, using the internal device speakers—another reason why I prefer larger devices. For pausing and resuming playback and skipping I use the watch, with the phone in my pocket or placed somewhere near. I never use AirPlay or listen over the stereo. Podcasts are near-field audio for me, they are personal. When another person enters the room, I stop playback. I quit listening on walks, prefering sounds of nature, the city, or company.

Constanly trying out new podcasts, my subscriptions level around one hundred podcasts. Three of my longtime favorites are [Scriptnotes](http://scriptnotes.net), [Longform](https://longform.org/podcast), and the [New Yorker Fiction](https://www.newyorker.com/podcast/fiction) podcast.

#### What do I want

- Access from all my devices
- Audio and video playback including streaming
- Browse and read show notes while playing
- Comprehensive queue
- Control Center and Apple Watch controls
- Good search for shows and episodes
- Informative lists leveraging landscape mode
- Snappy clear user interface
- Use the app offline

And what we all want, of course, a full battery. Especially relevant for hard working background apps, like podcast players, updating feeds and downloading audio files in the background.

#### Biting the bullet

Can I shift priorities and combine compromises in a way that lets me build a better podcast app? Probably not, such an app would exist by now, wouldn’t it?

The user interface of a podcast app is challenging, it has to communicate two narratives in parllel, information and playback. It’s different from something like Netflix in that way, the video app doesn’t let you browse, while you are watching. With an audio app you can be listening to one thing, while you’re looking at another—a player and a browser. Additionally, a good podcast app, while focusing on audio, must integrate video playback.

Unable to shake the question, I tricked myself into biting the bullet by deleting all podcast apps from my devices. If I wanted to listen to podcasts, I had to build an app. That was in 2014, Apple had just announced Swift. A good time for starting an app.

#### Download on the App Store

[![Podest](/img/podest_app_icon.svg "Podest App Icon")](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/podest/id794983364)

Podest is a simple, yet powerful podcast app. Its clear interface stays out of the way and puts podcast episodes center stage. Access all you need with the simple queue. Hear more without losing track.

Enough already! I’m reluctant to advertising my own work, just [try it](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/podest/id794983364). Please rate it or leave a review on the App Store.

Obviously, this late in the game, I’m not competing by piling up features, but by quality. Podest is all Swift and has around 70% logical code coverage at this point.

I’m in the process of open sourcing all components, publishing all Swift and JavaScript packages on [GitHub](https://github.com/michaelnisi/), many parts are already there.

But back to the initial question, at least for a second. Does it make sense to build something that already exists? Podest’s genesis is classic open source, scratching an itch. If you discover a use case, not yet covered by existing tools, and have the privilege to invest time, you should *build all the things*, picking up new technologies along the way—Swift in my case. Breaking your project down into modules makes time investment managable. At this point, being rewarded with each module you are releasing, the final product becomes secondary. Diversity produces progress. Always reinvent the wheel! That’s how we learn.

**There were plenty podcast players, but no podcast browser. Try Podest and tell me what you think.**
