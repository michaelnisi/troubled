Promoting my new app, available on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/podest/id794983364), I’m reminded of just how many podcast apps there are now. Searching for the term “podcast”, I look at a wall of apps. Eat that, I mumble, stuffing the fruit of my hard work into the saturated shelves. Arguably, this choir doesn’t scream for another *unique selling proposition*.

#### I love podcasts

Podcasts first clicked with me, when I discovered the [Stack Overflow podcast](https://stackoverflow.blog/2008/04/17/podcast-1/), back in 2008. This periodic conversation between [Joel Spolsky](https://www.joelonsoftware.com) and [Jeff Atwood](https://blog.codinghorror.com), about the progress of building their [site](https://stackoverflow.com), was an eye opener.

Listening to human voices at close range, over headphones or device speakers, can create an intimate bubble.

I have fond memories—strangely enough—of long wintery walks with the dog listening to [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net) and [Dan Benjamin](http://danbenjamin.com) chatting about Apple stuff on the original [Talk Show](http://5by5.tv/talkshow), of wiping the boarded floors of my pad to [The Book Review](https://www.nytimes.com/column/book-review-podcast), or [Pavel Mayer elucidating C++ on CRE](https://cre.fm/cre063-die-programmiersprache-c-plus-plus), with me sitting in front of the fire place, laptop on the floor.

Today, with all of us carrying connected audio devices in our pockets, capable of playback and recording, audio is big. Voice control. Recording. Listening. [The Daily](https://www.nytimes.com/podcasts/the-daily) promptly became a household name during the 2016 election campaign, reaching [five million unique listeners every month](https://www.recode.net/2018/2/13/17005660/new-york-times-the-daily-american-public-media-radio-podcast-michael-barbaro-lisa-tobin-code-media). Pioneers, like [Radio Open Source](http://radioopensource.org), [99pi](https://99percentinvisible.org), [This American Life](https://www.thisamericanlife.org), or [Radio Lab](https://www.wnycstudios.org/shows/radiolab), are still going strong.

Podcast labels—publishing and production—are a thing now. [Radiotopia](https://www.radiotopia.fm), [Wondery](https://wondery.com), [Headgum](https://headgum.com), [Gimlet](https://www.gimletmedia.com), and [Pineapple Street Media](http://pineapple.fm), to name a few. Being German myself, shoutouts to [Metaebene](https://metaebene.me), [Viertausendhertz](https://viertausendhertz.de), [hauseins](https://hauseins.fm), and [Pool Artists](http://www.poolartists.de), with the splashy [WIMAF](https://wimaf.podigee.io) podcast.

Print publications understand how podcasts bond readers with writers, getting them closer to their brands. Not only newspapers, like [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/audio) and [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/podcasts), also magazines—[Monocle](https://monocle.com/radio/), [The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/podcast), and more recently [New York Magazine](http://nymag.com), which just premiered [The Cut on Tuesdays](https://www.thecut.com/2019/10/the-cut-on-tuesdays-podcast-episode-1-power.html), a new weekly with Gimlet—publish splendid audio. In Germany, [Die Zeit](https://www.zeit.de/podcasts) got the memo.

Digital natives, [Slate](http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts.html), [Vox](https://www.vox.com/pages/podcasts), [Recode](https://www.recode.net/podcasts/), and [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/podcasts), are already there.

[SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/for/podcasting), [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com), and [Deezer](https://www.deezer.com/) have integrated podcasts into their offerings. Amazon produces podcasts—for [Alexa](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa)—with its audio book company [Audible](https://www.audible.com/blog/). But these products are chimera, for something to call itself a podcast, it must provide some kind of public feed, I think.

After merely mirroring their signals into the podcast space, following early adopters like [NPR](https://www.npr.org) or [WYNC](https://www.wnyc.org), grand broadcasters like the [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts) are getting serious.

[Stitcher](https://www.stitcher.com) cultivates a collection of podcasts, an alternative to the original [iTunes](https://www.apple.com/itunes/podcasts/). Apple, inventor of the [iPod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod), in 2001, was among the founders of [podcast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast) land.

I forget how I initially listened. With iTunes and iPod, I guess,  [casually moonwalking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTwd7SaYPQg) out the door in baggy pants.

#### Apps are made of priorities and compromises

Came iPhone, of course, I began with Apple [Podcasts](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/podcasts/id525463029) and later [Downcast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/downcast/id393858566), which I used for quite some time. Then came [Instacast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/instacast-core/id108386833), which I liked, but as it turned out, didn’t scale to hundreds of subscriptions. I had to return to Apple Podcasts. I kept trying [Overcast](https://overcast.fm), but stuck with Apple Podcasts in the end—apparently made by developers who aren’t into podcasts.

Recently, I took another look at [Pocket Casts](https://play.pocketcasts.com) and, despite its complexity, it might be an option—if there wasn’t another alternative. 😇

Apps are made of priorities and compromises. From time to time, I try some of the newer ones coming out, but find most of them confusing. I won’t wade through a tutorial to listen to a podcast. After a decade of podcasts on iPhone, I have not found an app I really like.

#### You're holding it wrong

My way of consuming podcasts might be unfit for the available apps. How do I listen to podcasts? I don’t walk the streets with headphones and I don’t have a commute. I listen at home, walking around the house, doing chores, while shaving or in bed before sleep, without headphones, using the internal device speakers—another reason why I prefer larger devices. For pausing and resuming playback and skipping I use the watch, with the phone in my pocket or placed somewhere near. I never use AirPlay or listen over the stereo. Podcasts are near-field audio for me, they are personal. When another person enters the room, I stop playback. I quit listening on walks, preferring sounds of nature, the city, or company.

Constantly trying out new podcasts, my subscriptions level around one hundred podcasts. Three of my longtime favorites, maybe slightly off the beaten path, are [Scriptnotes](http://scriptnotes.net), [Longform](https://longform.org/podcast), and the [New Yorker Fiction](https://www.newyorker.com/podcast/fiction) podcast.

#### What do I want

- Access from all my devices
- Audio and video playback including streaming
- Browse and read show notes while playing
- Comprehensive queue
- Control Center and Apple Watch controls
- Good search for shows and episodes
- Informative lists leveraging landscape mode
- No sign up
- Snappy clear user interface
- Use the app offline

And what we all want, of course, a full battery. Especially relevant for hard working background apps, like podcast players, updating feeds and downloading audio files in the background.

#### Biting the bullet

Can I shift priorities and combine compromises in a way that lets me build a better podcast app? Probably not, such an app would exist by now, wouldn’t it?

The user interface of a podcast app is challenging, it has to communicate two narratives in parallel, information and playback. It’s different from something like Netflix in that way, the video app doesn’t let you browse, while you are watching. With an audio app you can be listening to one thing, while you’re looking at another—a player and a browser. Additionally, a good podcast app, while focusing on audio, must integrate video playback.

Unable to shake the question, I tricked myself into biting the bullet by deleting all podcast apps from my devices. If I wanted to listen to podcasts, I had to build an app. That was in 2014, Apple had just announced Swift. A good time for starting an app.

#### Download on the App Store

[![Podest](/img/podest_app_icon.svg "Podest App Icon")](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/podest/id794983364)

Podest is a simple, yet powerful podcast app. Its clear interface stays out of the way and puts podcast episodes center stage. Access all your episodes, subscriptions, and other podcasts from a single list—your queue. Enjoy more podcasts without losing track.

Enough of that, I don’t want to repeat the pitch here, check the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/podest/id794983364) and download the app. Please leave a rating or a review to support this indie project. That would make me happy.

Back to the initial question. Why another podcast app? Why build something that, in some form or the other, already exists? Podest’s genesis is classic open source, scratching an itch. I answered the personal need for a simpler way of listening to podcasts—something I’m truly passionate about—in the hopes if I’m looking an alternative podcast app, others might be looking too.

To generalize, if you discover a use case, not or unsatisfyingly covered by existing tools and you are privileged to invest time, you should *build all the things*, picking up new technologies along the way—here Swift. Like podcast user interfaces, those unresolved problems, of course, tend to be inherently tough nuts to crack. Breaking your project down into modules makes the time investment manageable and the final composite becomes secondary, for you are rewarded with each module. Open sourcing components generates intermediate products, hardens resiliency through wider usage, and might be instructive for others. Reading code and contributing to open source are excellent means for learning.

Podest is mostly open source. Some packages and the app itself, using frameworks the least exciting part, still need to be published on [GitHub](https://github.com/michaelnisi/). I want to make Podest 100% open source.

**There were plenty podcast players, but no podcast browser. Try Podest and tell me what you think.**
