While Iâ€™m busy releasing my new podcast app on the App Store, Iâ€™m reminded of just how many podcast apps exist. Why exactly did I write one in the first place? Does this choir of apps, offering themselves in the search results, ask for another contender, pleading for its use? Faced with marketing blurb fabrication pressure to climb these ranks, I doubt it. Isnâ€™t it a waste of energy, when so many developers are pouring their energy and time into similar products?

Diversity results in progress. Always reinvent the wheel! Thatâ€™s how we learn.

There were plenty podcast players, but no podcast browser. Try it and tell me what you think.
