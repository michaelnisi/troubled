Promoting my new podcast app, available on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/podest/id794983364), I’m reminded of just how many podcast apps there are now. Searching the term “podcast” in the store, you are faced with a wall of podcast players. I came for glory, not for squeezing my hard work into this saturated space. Does this choir of apps, blaring their unique selling propositions, need another voice in its cacophony?

#### I love podcasts

Podcasts first clicked with, when I discovered [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.blog/2008/04/17/podcast-1/), back in 2008. This weekly conversation between [Joel Spolsky](https://www.joelonsoftware.com) and [Jeff Atwood](https://blog.codinghorror.com) about the progress of building the [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) site was eye opening. Listening to human voices at close range, over headphones of device speakers, can create an intimate bubble, a feeling of connectedness between listener and hosts. I have fond memories—strangely enough—of long wintery walks with the dog listening to [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net) and [Dan Benjamin](http://danbenjamin.com) chatting about Apple stuff on [The Talk Show](http://5by5.tv/talkshow), of wiping the wooden floors of my St. Georg apartment to [The Book Review](https://www.nytimes.com/column/book-review-podcast), or listening to [Pavel Mayer explaining C++ on CRE](https://cre.fm/cre063-die-programmiersprache-c-plus-plus) in front of the fire place with my laptop on the floor.

Today, podcasts are in bloom—again. [The Daily](https://www.nytimes.com/podcasts/the-daily) quickly became a household name during the 2016 election campaign. Pioneers like Radio Open Source, 99pi, This American Life, Radio Lab are still going strong. Podcast labels are thing now, Radiotopia, Wondery, Headgum, Gimlet, Pineapple, or the German Viertausendhertz. Print publications understand that podcasts create bonds between their writes and their readers: Monocle, New York Times, New Yorker, New York Magazine. Digital natives like Slate, Vox, or The Verge feel right at home in podcast land. After merely mirroring their signals into this space, following early adopters like NPR or WYNC, traditional broadcasters like the [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts) are getting serious. As we adopt talking to our machines, it kind of makes sense we are listening too. Why doesn’t Siri have a podcast?

#### Apps are made of priorities and compromises

I forget how I listened first, on the Mac with iTunes, I guess. On the phone, I used [Podcasts](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/podcasts/id525463029) and [Downcast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/downcast/id393858566), which is still around, as I have just admiringly noticed, frantically scrolling the App Store search results for the term 'Podcasts'—I’m one of those people now. After [Instacast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/instacast-core/id108386833), the one with the lifted name and problems with too many subscriptions, I returned to Apple Podcasts. For a second I tried [Overcast](https://overcast.fm), but fell back on Podcasts, which got worse with each update. Apps are made of priorities and compromises. Occassionally, I try one of the newer apps coming out, but I find them bloated and confusing. [Castro](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/castro-podcasts/id1080840241), for example, a super well made app, but too much for me.

The long and short of it, I never had a podcast app I liked, at least in this decade, before, I was stoked carrying podcasts in my pocket in the first place.

But why is that? How come all podcast apps feel off-center to me? Could I build something better?

#### What do I want?

- Audio and Video Playback including streaming
- Being offline should be fine
- Clear user interface
- Good search for shows and episodes
- Powerful landscape mode—I like larger screens
- Read about episodes before playing them
- Sync

The user interface of a podcast app is challenging, it has to communicate two narratives, information and playback. You can look at one thing, while you are playing another thing. A browser and a player.

I immediately quit using other apps, even looking at them. I wanted to go about this fresh. For a while, until I had build a somewhat working player, I stopped listening to podcasts.

Podest is a simple, yet powerful podcast app. Obviously, this late in the party I’m not trying to compete with the quantity of features, but with quality.

Here is a quick rundown of features in this first release.

- Audio and Video Playback
- Automatic Downloads
- Background Updates
- Energy Efficiency
- Episode Focused Browsing
- Landscape Mode
- Now Playing Controls
- Offline First
- Pragmatic Queue
- Search Shows and Episodes
- Synced Playback Resuming
- iCloud Sync of Queue and Subscriptions
- Open Source

Check the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/podest/id794983364) for details. Find most of the source code on my [GitHub](https://github.com/michaelnisi/).

#### Download on the App Store

Back to the initial question. Does it make sense to build something that already exists? If you think you can improve something, of course, but even if not. If you can, you should build all the things. Diversity produces progress. Always reinvent the wheel! That’s how we learn.

**There were plenty podcast players, but no podcast browser. Try it and tell me what you think.**
