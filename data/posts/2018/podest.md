Promoting my new podcast app, available on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/podest/id794983364), I’m reminded of just how many podcast apps there are—now. Searching the term “podcast” in the store, I face a wall of podcast players. *I came for glory,* I shout shaking my fist, not for squeezing my hard work into these saturated shelves. Does this choir of apps, blaring their unique selling propositions, ask for another voice in its cacophony?

#### I love podcasts

Podcasts first clicked with me, when I discovered the [Stack Overflow podcast](https://stackoverflow.blog/2008/04/17/podcast-1/), back in 2008. This periodic conversation between [Joel Spolsky](https://www.joelonsoftware.com) and [Jeff Atwood](https://blog.codinghorror.com), about the progress of building their [site](https://stackoverflow.com), was an eye opener. Listening to human voices at close range, over headphones or device speakers, can create an intimate bubble, a feeling of connectedness between listener and hosts. I have fond memories—strangely enough—of long wintery walks with the dog listening to [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net) and [Dan Benjamin](http://danbenjamin.com) chatting about Apple stuff on the original [Talk Show](http://5by5.tv/talkshow), of wiping the wooden floors of my St. Georg apartment to [The Book Review](https://www.nytimes.com/column/book-review-podcast), or listening to [Pavel Mayer elucidating C++ on CRE](https://cre.fm/cre063-die-programmiersprache-c-plus-plus) in front of the fire place with my laptop on the floor.

Today, with everyone carrying a connected—playback and recording—device in their pockets, audio is big—for voice control and listening. [The Daily](https://www.nytimes.com/podcasts/the-daily) quickly became a household name during the 2016 election campaign, reaching five million unique listeners every month, [they say](https://www.recode.net/2018/2/13/17005660/new-york-times-the-daily-american-public-media-radio-podcast-michael-barbaro-lisa-tobin-code-media). Pioneers like [Radio Open Source](http://radioopensource.org), [99pi](https://99percentinvisible.org), [This American Life](https://www.thisamericanlife.org), [Radio Lab](https://www.wnycstudios.org/shows/radiolab) are still going strong.

Podcast labels—publishing and production—are a thing now: [Radiotopia](https://www.radiotopia.fm), [Wondery](https://wondery.com), [Headgum](https://headgum.com), [Gimlet](https://www.gimletmedia.com), [Pineapple Street Media](http://pineapple.fm) to name a few. I also want to mention the German studios [Viertausendhertz](https://viertausendhertz.de), [Pool Artists](http://www.poolartists.de), and [Metaebene](https://metaebene.me).

Print publications understand that podcasts bond readers with writers, deepening the connection to their brands. Not only newspapers, like [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/audio) and [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/podcasts), also magazines—[Monocle](https://monocle.com/radio/), [New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/podcast), and more recently [New York Magazine](http://nymag.com), which just premiered [The Cut on Tuesdays](https://www.thecut.com/2019/10/the-cut-on-tuesdays-podcast-episode-1-power.html), a new weekly with Gimlet—are creating splendid audio. In Germany, [Die Zeit](https://www.zeit.de/podcasts) got the memo.

Digital natives, [Slate](http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts.html), [Vox](https://www.vox.com/pages/podcasts), or [Recode](https://www.recode.net/podcasts/) and [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/podcasts), are already there.

[SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/for/podcasting), [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com), and [Deezer](https://www.deezer.com/) have integrated podcasts into their offerings. Amazon produces podcasts—for [Alexa](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa) I guess—with its audio book company [Audible](https://www.audible.com/blog/). But these products are chimera, for something to call itself a podcast, it must have a public feed, in my opinion at least.

After merely mirroring their signals into the podcast space, following early adopters like [NPR](https://www.npr.org) or [WYNC](https://www.wnyc.org), grand broadcasters like the [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts) are getting serious.

[Stitcher](https://www.stitcher.com) cultivates a collection of podcasts, an alternative to the original [iTunes](https://www.apple.com/itunes/podcasts/), being the inventor of the [iPod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod), in 2001, Apple has been among the founders of [podcast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast) land.

#### Apps are made of priorities and compromises

I have forgotten how I intitially listened, with iTunes and iPod, I think. On iPhone, of course, I began with Apple [Podcasts](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/podcasts/id525463029) and later [Downcast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/downcast/id393858566), which I used for quite some time. Then came [Instacast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/instacast-core/id108386833), which I liked, but as it turned out, didn’t scale to hundreds of subscriptions. I had to return to Apple Podcasts. I kept trying [Overcast](https://overcast.fm), but stuck with Apple Podcasts, apparently made by developers who did not listen to podcasts, at least back then.

Apps are made of priorities and compromises. From time to time, I try one of the newer apps coming out, but find them confusing. If a podcast app requires me to wade through a tutorial, something went wrong. This all goes to show, after a decade of listening, I have not found a podcast app I enjoy—here be dragons.

#### You're holding it wrong

My way of consuming podcasts might be unfit for the available apps. How do I listen to podcasts? I don’t walk the streets with headphones and I don’t have a commute. I listen at home, walking around the house, doing chors, while shaving or in bed before sleep, without headphones, using the internal device speakers—another reason why I prefer larger devices. For pausing and resuming playback and skipping I use the watch, with the phone in my pocket or placed somewhere near. I never use AirPlay or listen over the stereo. Podcasts are near-field audio for me, they are personal. When another person enters the room, I stop playback. I quit listening on walks, prefering sounds of nature, the city, or company.

Constanly trying out new podcasts, my subscriptions level around one hundred podcasts. Three of my longtime favorites are [Scriptnotes](http://scriptnotes.net), [Longform](https://longform.org/podcast), and the [New Yorker Fiction](https://www.newyorker.com/podcast/fiction) podcast.

#### What do I want

- Audio and video playback including streaming
- Use the app offline
- Clear user interface
- Good search for shows and episodes
- Informative lists leveraging landscape mode
- Browse and read show notes while playing
- Access from all my devices
- Control Center and Apple Watch controls

And what we all want, from all apps, a snappy user interface that stays of the way and a full battery.

#### Biting the bullet

Can I shift priorities and combine compromises in a way that lets me build a better podcast app? Probably not, such an app would exist by now, wouldn’t it?

The user interface of a podcast app is challenging, it has to communicate two narratives in parllel, information and playback. It’s different from Netflix in that way, the video app doesn’t let you browse, while you are watching. With an audio app you can be listening to one thing, while you’re looking at another—a player and a browser. Additionally, a good podcast app, while focusing on audio, must integrate video playback.

Unable to shake the question, I tricked myself into biting the bullet by deleting all podcast apps from my devices. If I wanted to listen to podcasts, I had to build an app. That was in 2014, Apple had just announced Swift. A good time for starting an app.

#### Download on the App Store

[![Podest](/img/podest_app_icon.svg "Podest App Icon")](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/podest/id794983364)

Podest is a simple, yet powerful podcast app. Obviously, this late in the game, I’m not competing by counting features, that wasn’t the goal of this app in the first place—lean and mean—but where I want to compete it quality. Podest is all Swift and has around 70% logical code coverage at this point. I’m in the process of open sourcing all components of this app, all the Swift and JavaScript modules get published on [GitHub](https://github.com/michaelnisi/), many parts are already there.

Check the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/podest/id794983364) for details. If you have read this far, why not rate the app or write a review? That would help me a lot—thank you.

But back to the initial question for a second. Does it make sense to build something that already exists? If you think you can improve something, of course, but even if not. Podest has the classic open source genesis, scratching an itch. If you feel like it and have the privilege to invest the time, you should build all the things. Break things down into modules and the time investment becomes managable. Diversity produces progress. Always reinvent the wheel! That’s how we learn.

**There were plenty podcast players, but no podcast browser. Try it and tell me what you think.**
