Promoting my new podcast app, available on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/podest/id794983364), I’m reminded of just how many podcast apps there are—now. Searching the term “podcast” in the store, I face a wall of podcast players. *I came for glory,* I shout shaking my fist, not for squeezing my hard work into these saturated shelves. Does this choir of apps, blaring their unique selling propositions, ask for another voice in its cacophony?

#### I love podcasts

Podcasts first clicked with me, when I discovered the [Stack Overflow podcast](https://stackoverflow.blog/2008/04/17/podcast-1/), back in 2008. This periodic conversation between [Joel Spolsky](https://www.joelonsoftware.com) and [Jeff Atwood](https://blog.codinghorror.com), about the progress of building their [site](https://stackoverflow.com), was an eye opener. Listening to human voices at close range, over headphones or device speakers, can create an intimate bubble, a feeling of connectedness between listener and hosts. I have fond memories—strangely enough—of long wintery walks with the dog listening to [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net) and [Dan Benjamin](http://danbenjamin.com) chatting about Apple stuff on the original [Talk Show](http://5by5.tv/talkshow), of wiping the wooden floors of my St. Georg apartment to [The Book Review](https://www.nytimes.com/column/book-review-podcast), or listening to [Pavel Mayer elucidating C++ on CRE](https://cre.fm/cre063-die-programmiersprache-c-plus-plus) in front of the fire place with my laptop on the floor.

Today, with everyone carrying a connected—playback and recording—device in their pockets, audio is big—for voice control and listening. [The Daily](https://www.nytimes.com/podcasts/the-daily) quickly became a household name during the 2016 election campaign, reaching five million unique listeners every month, [they say](https://www.recode.net/2018/2/13/17005660/new-york-times-the-daily-american-public-media-radio-podcast-michael-barbaro-lisa-tobin-code-media). Pioneers like [Radio Open Source](http://radioopensource.org), [99pi](https://99percentinvisible.org), [This American Life](https://www.thisamericanlife.org), [Radio Lab](https://www.wnycstudios.org/shows/radiolab) are still going strong.

> Podcasting continues to grow year after year. ([Nielsen](https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/reports/2018/nielsen-podcast-insights-q3-2018.html))

Podcast labels—publishing and production—are a thing now: [Radiotopia](https://www.radiotopia.fm), [Wondery](https://wondery.com), [Headgum](https://headgum.com), [Gimlet](https://www.gimletmedia.com), [Pineapple Street Media](http://pineapple.fm) to name a few. I also want to mention the German studios [Viertausendhertz](https://viertausendhertz.de), [Pool Artists](http://www.poolartists.de), and [Metaebene](https://metaebene.me).

Print publications understand that podcasts bond readers with writers, deepening the connection to their brands. Not only newspapers, like [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/audio) and [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/podcasts), also magazines—[Monocle](https://monocle.com/radio/), [New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/podcast), and more recently [New York Magazine](http://nymag.com/tags/podcast/)—are creating stunning audio experiences.

Digital natives, [Slate](http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts.html), [Vox](https://www.vox.com/pages/podcasts), or [Recode](https://www.recode.net/podcasts/) and [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/podcasts), are already there. [The Cut](https://thecut.com) just released their [first episode](https://www.thecut.com/2018/10/the-cut-on-tuesdays-podcast-episode-1-power.html).

Streaming services like [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/for/podcasting), [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com), [Deezer](https://www.deezer.com/) integrate podcasts. Amazon produces podcasts—for [Alexa](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa) I guess—with its audio book company [Audible](https://www.audible.com/blog/), but for something to call itself podcast it must have a public feed, per definition.

After merely mirroring their signals into the podcast space, following early adopters like [NPR](https://www.npr.org) or [WYNC](https://www.wnyc.org), broadcasters like the [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts) are getting serious.

[Stitcher](https://www.stitcher.com) cultivates a collection of podcasts, an alternative to the original [iTunes](https://www.apple.com/itunes/podcasts/), being the inventor of the [iPod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod), in 2001, Apple is a founder [podcast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast) land.

#### Apps are made of priorities and compromises

I forget how I listened first, on the Mac with iTunes, I guess. On the phone, I used [Podcasts](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/podcasts/id525463029) and [Downcast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/downcast/id393858566), which is still around, as I have just admiringly noticed, frantically scrolling the App Store search results for the term 'Podcasts'—I’m one of those people now. After [Instacast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/instacast-core/id108386833), the one with the lifted name and problems with too many subscriptions, I returned to Apple Podcasts. For a second I tried [Overcast](https://overcast.fm), but fell back on Podcasts, which got worse with each update. Apps are made of priorities and compromises. Occassionally, I try one of the newer apps coming out, but I find them bloated and confusing. [Castro](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/castro-podcasts/id1080840241), for example, a super well made app, but too much for me. After a decade of listening to podcasts, I have not found an app I like. Admittedly, I haven’t looked at Pocket, Deezer, and Spotify for too long. Writing this, I consider reviewing each, a post with one paragraph reviews of each podcast app would be a hit, I guess.

#### How do I listen

My way of consuming podcasts might be unfit for the available apps. How do I listen to podcasts? I don’t walk the streets with headphones and I don’t have a commute. I listen at home, walking around the house, doing chors, while shaving or in bed before sleep, without headphones, using the internal device speakers—another reason why I prefer larger devices. For pausing and resuming playback and skipping I use the watch, with the phone in my pocket or placed somewhere near. I never use AirPlay or listen over the stereo. Podcasts are near-field audio for me, they are personal. When another person enters the room, I stop playback. I quit listening on walks, prefering sounds of nature, the city, or company.

Constanly trying out new podcasts, my subscriptions level around one hundred podcasts. Three of my regulars, I love and have been listening to for years, are [Scriptnotes](http://scriptnotes.net), [Longform](https://longform.org/podcast), and the [New Yorker Fiction](https://www.newyorker.com/podcast/fiction) podcast.

I never tinker with playback speed. Podcasts are sound, editors put effort into that shit. At what speed do you listen to music?

Chapters? I don’t need those. That’s what episodes are for, skipping forward means next episode. Don’t @ me.

#### What do I want

Can I shift priorities and combine compromises in a way that lets me build a better podcasts app?

- Audio and video playback including streaming
- Use the app offline
- Clear user interface
- Good search for shows and episodes
- Enriching landscape mode
- Read about episodes before playing them
- Access from all my devices
- Solid skipping via Control Center and Apple Watch

And what we all want: a snappy experience, a full battery, and not being bothered. I just want to listen to podcasts, that’s it.

#### Inverted approach to building it

The user interface of a podcast app is challenging, it has to communicate two narratives, information and playback. You can look at one thing, while you are playing another thing. A browser and a player.

[![Podest](/img/podest.svg "Podest Logotype")](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/podest/id794983364)

Once I had a somewhat working prototype, I quit using other apps. I deleted them from my phone to go about this fresh. This was great for motivation, when my app didn’t work, I wasn’t able to listen to podcasts. I’m the [first customer](https://github.com/joyent/eng/blob/master/docs/index.md#rule-1-fcs-quality-all-the-time), dogfooding daily builds.

Podest is a simple, yet powerful podcast app. Obviously, this late in the party I’m not trying to compete with the quantity of features, but with quality.

[![Podest](/img/podest_app_icon.svg "Podest App Icon")](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/podest/id794983364)

- Audio and video playback
- Powerful search
- Accessible from all your iOS devices
- Energy efficiency
- Landscape mode

Check the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/podest/id794983364) for details.

I’m in the process of open sourcing all components of this app, all the Swift and JavaScript modules get published on [GitHub](https://github.com/michaelnisi/), many parts are already there.

#### Improving internal playback controls and dark mode

Once my modest promoting the app is concluded, I will work on the internal player controls—currently the relies on Control Center for scrubbing—adding controls for scrubbing, skipping a few seconds forward, and a sleep function. After that I want to add dark mode, although iOS might be surfacing an API for it in the near future.

#### Download on the App Store

Back to the initial question. Does it make sense to build something that already exists? If you think you can improve something, of course, but even if not. If you can, you should build all the things. Diversity produces progress. Always reinvent the wheel! That’s how we learn.


**There were plenty podcast players, but no podcast browser. Try it and tell me what you think.**
