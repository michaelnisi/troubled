While Iâ€™m busy releasing my new podcast app on the App Store, Iâ€™m reminded of just how many podcast apps exist. Why exactly did I write one in the first place? Does this choir of apps, offering themselves in the search results, ask for another contender, pleading for its use? Faced with marketing blurb fabrication pressure to climb these ranks, I doubt it. Isnâ€™t it a waste of energy, when so many developers are pouring their energy and time into similar products?

## I ðŸ’œ Podcasts

I remember listening to my first podcasts on my computer, which sounds weird now, like eating soup with a fork. Among the first shows Iâ€™ve followed, come the iPhone, were [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.blog/2008/04/17/podcast-1/), [The Book Review Podcast](https://www.nytimes.com/column/book-review-podcast) by [The Times](https://www.nytimes.com), and, Chris Lydonâ€™s, true founding father of podcasting, [Radio Open Source](http://radioopensource.org). I fondly remember immersing myself into [Chaos Radio Express](https://cre.fm) and my beloved [KÃ¼chenradio](https://www.kuechenstud.io/kuechenradio/), pioneering German shows, back in 2010. Podcasts are a personal medium, indeed.

Today, podcasts are in bloomâ€”again. [The Daily](https://www.nytimes.com/podcasts/the-daily) quickly became a household name, [The New Yorker Radio Hour](https://www.newyorker.com/podcast/the-new-yorker-radio-hour) is a classic by now, and Britainâ€™s [Monocle](https://monocle.com) has its own [radio station](https://monocle.com/radio/). Dedicated podcast labels flourish: [Radiotopia](https://www.radiotopia.fm), [Gimlet](https://www.gimletmedia.com), [Crooked Media](https://crooked.com) to name a few. For me, no week goes by without [Slateâ€™s Culture Gabfest](http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/culturegabfest.html) and [Still Processing](https://www.nytimes.com/podcasts/still-processing), another fine [Pineapple](http://pineapple.fm) production.

#### Apps are made of priorities and compromises

I forget how I listened first, on the Mac, *iTunes*, I guess. On the phone, I used [Podcasts](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/podcasts/id525463029) and [Downcast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/downcast/id393858566), which is still around, as I just saw, scanning the App Store search results for the term 'Podcasts'. After [Instacast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/instacast-core/id108386833), the one with the lifted name and problems with too many subscriptions, I returned to *Podcasts*. For a moment I tried [Overcast](https://overcast.fm), but fell back on *Podcasts*, which got worse with each update. Apps are made of priorities and compromises. Occassionally, I try one of the newer apps coming out, but I find them bloated and confusing. [Castro](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/castro-podcasts/id1080840241), for example, a super well made app, but too much for me.

The long and short of it, I never had a podcast app I liked, at least in this decade, before, I was stoked carrying podcasts in my pocket in the first place.

But why is that? How come all podcast apps feel off-center to me? Could I build something better?
