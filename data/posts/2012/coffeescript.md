In the end CoffeeScript is just JavaScript, but along the way of writing code it is much more.

Advantages
- No global variables, CommonJS modules
- No superset, whitespaceâ€”sane formatting
- Less lines, less code
- The last expression in a function is returned
- splats and default arguments
- comprehensions
- strings
- fat arrow function
- myFunction(item) for item in items

I am especially inclined by the subtle push to a more functional programmning style by the implicit return of each function's last statement.
