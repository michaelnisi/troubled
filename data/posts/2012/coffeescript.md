CoffeeScript is the little mystery programming language, written by Jeremy Ashkenas, that transcompiles to JavaScript. The language is inspired by Ruby, Python and Haskell; it adds features like array comprehension and pattern matching.

I never been fond of transcompilation, but CoffeeScript's elegance seduced me to try it. With my first sips of CoffeeScript my skepticism transformed into enthusiasm, writing plain JavaScript just doesn't cut it anymore. It has this stale taste of something that was great in the past, but when revisited, isn't that great anymore. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate JavaScript. ActionScript, an ECMAScript derivate, had been my bread and butter language for the longest time, so my relationship with JavaScript is rather intimate, which is probably one of the reasons why I'm embracing CoffeeScript. So, what are the main advantages?



No global variables, CommonJS modules

No superset, whitespaceâ€”sane formatting

Less lines, less code

The last expression in a function is returned

splats and default arguments

comprehensions

strings

fat arrow function

myFunction(item) for item in items

Destructuring assignments

	{a, b} = { a:'a', b:'b' }
	console.log "a is '#{a}', b is '#{b}'"

It's just JavaScript.
