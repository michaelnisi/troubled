*Oh hey, thanks for your interest.* [The Troubled Programmer](/) is written by me, my name is Michael Nisi, I am a programmer. After years of [OOP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) in mainly ActionScript, these days my main interest lies in concurrency and functional programming. 

In regards of languages, I'm into JavaScript, C, Objective-C and Erlang.

The two platforms I'm really excited about these days are Node.js and iOS.

I love the web; therefore I am a great believer in [web standards](http://www.webstandards.org) and [responsive design](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design). Here I write to learn and to share.

If you are interested you could follow me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/michaelnisi), fork me on [GitHub](https://github.com/michaelnisi) or have a look at my photos on [Flickr](http://flickr.com/photos/michaelnisi). Also you could watch images and videos I like on [Zootool](http://zoo.tl/u/michaelnisi/) and [Vimeo](http://www.vimeo.com/user5635710/likes).
