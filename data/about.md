[The Troubled Programmer](/) is written by me, Michael Nisi. I make software.

As an application developer, my objective is to build meaningful mobile applications for end users, while improving software reliability and maintainability.

In this blog, I write about software making, open source, and quality. With my background in art and design, I bring a holistic perspective to the field.

> It is the pervading law of all things organic and inorganic, of all things physical and metaphysical, of all things human, and all things super-human, of all true manifestations of the head, of the heart, of the soul, that the life is recognizable in its expression, that form ever follows function. *This is the law.*

I like building things with [Node](https://github.com/michaelnisi/manger), [Swift](https://github.com/michaelnisi/fileproxy), [Erlang](https://github.com/michaelnisi/feeder), and [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/). Iâ€™m the author of [Podest](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/podest/id794983364), a podcast app for iOS.
