OH HEY, thanks for your interest. [The Troubled Programmer](/) is written by Michael Nisi, that’s me—I make software. One foot on [OOP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming), the other on [functional programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming), I test my way through the troubled waters of software development.

I love [Erlang](http://erlang.org/), but mostly write [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), and [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) to build mobile applications with [iOS](http://apple.com/ios/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

> Sing clearvoice Muse, of Hephaestus famed for skill. With bright-eyed Athena he taught men glorious crafts throughout the world—men who before used to dwell in caves in the mountains like wild beasts. But now that they have leared crafts through Hephaestus famous for his art they live a peaceful life in their own houses the whole year round.
