*Oh hey, thanks for your interest.* [The Troubled Programmer](/) is written by me, my name is <span itemprop="name">Michael Nisi</span>, I am a programmer. After a decade of [OOP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming), I am now more given to [functional programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming). 

I write [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript), [C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)), [Objective-C](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjectiveC/Introduction/introObjectiveC.html), and [Erlang](http://www.erlang.org/). The platforms I write for are [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [iOS](https://developer.apple.com/technologies/ios/), and [Erlang/OTP](http://learnyousomeerlang.com/what-is-otp).

> Those who want really reliable software will discover that they must find means of avoiding the majority of bugs to start with, and as a result, the programming process will become cheaper. If you want more effective programmers, you will discover that they should not waste their time debugging, they should not introduce the bugs to start with.

>â€”*Edsger W. Dijkstra*, The Humble Programmer

I humbly attempt to realize Dijkstra's vision through [TDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development).
