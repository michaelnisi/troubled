[The Troubled Programmer](/) is written by me, Michael Nisi. I make software.

As an application developer, my objective is to build meaningful mobile applications for end users, while improving software reliability and maintainability.

In this blog, I write about software making, open source, and quality. With my background in art and design, I bring a holistic perspective to the field.

#### Form and function are one

> Five lines where three are enough is always stupidity. Nine pounds where three are sufficient is obesity… To know what to leave out and what to put in, just where and just how, ah, that is to have been educated in knowledge of simplicity—toward ultimate freedom of expression.—*Frank Lloyd Wright*

I like building things with [Swift](https://github.com/michaelnisi/fileproxy) and [Node.js](https://github.com/michaelnisi/manger), sometimes [Erlang/OTP](https://github.com/michaelnisi/feeder). I’m the author of [Podest](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/podest/id794983364), a podcast app for iOS.
