*Oh hey, thanks for your interest.* [The Troubled Programmer](/) is written by me, my name is Michael Nisi, I am an independent software developer. These days my main interest lies in concurrency and functional programming. In regards of programming languages I am concentrating on [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript), [C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)), [Objective-C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C) and [Erlang](http://www.erlang.org). I love the web; therefore I am a great believer in [web standards](http://www.webstandards.org) and [responsive design](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design). I write here to learn and to share some hopefully relevant nuggets, unearthed by me or found somewhere else.

If you are interested you could follow me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/michaelnisi), fork me on [GitHub](https://github.com/michaelnisi) or have a look at my photos on [Flickr](http://flickr.com/photos/michaelnisi). Also you could watch images and videos I like on [Zootool](http://zoo.tl/u/michaelnisi/), [Vimeo](http://www.vimeo.com/user5635710/likes) and [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/user/pixotz). If you are game you could listen to my sounds on [SoundCloud](http://soundcloud.com/michaelnisi) or check my filmography on [Mubi](http://mubi.com/users/164590/filmography).
