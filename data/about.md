*Oh hey, thanks for your interest.* [The Troubled Programmer](/) is written by me, my name is Michael Nisi, I am an independent software developer. After years of [OOP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming), these days my main interest lays in concurrency and functional programming.

In regards of programming languages I am concentrating on [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript), [C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)), [Objective-C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C) and [Erlang](http://www.erlang.org). Recently I got hooked on [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) and [Lua](http://www.lua.org/). 

I love the web; therefore I am a great believer in [web standards](http://www.webstandards.org) and [responsive design](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design). I'm writing here to learn and to share.

If you are interested you could follow me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/michaelnisi), fork me on [GitHub](https://github.com/michaelnisi) or have a look at my photos on [Flickr](http://flickr.com/photos/michaelnisi). Also you could watch images and videos I like on [Zootool](http://zoo.tl/u/michaelnisi/), [Vimeo](http://www.vimeo.com/user5635710/likes) and [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/user/pixotz).
