*Oh hey, thanks for your interest.* [The Troubled Programmer](/) is written by me, my name is Michael Nisi, I make software. After a decade of [OOP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming), I am now more given to [functional programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming).

I love [Erlang](http://erlang.org/), but mostly write [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), and [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) to build mobile applications with [iOS](http://apple.com/ios/) and [Node](https://nodejs.org/).

> Sing clearvoice Muse of Hephaestus famed for skill. With bright-eyed Athena he taught men glorious crafts throughout the world—men who before used to dwell in caves in the mountains like wild beasts. But now that they have leared crafts through Hephaestus famous for his art they live a peaceful life in their own houses the whole year round.
