*Oh hey, thanks for your interest.* [The Troubled Programmer](/) is written by me, my name is Michael Nisi, I am an independent software developer. These days my main interest lies in concurrency and functional programming. In regards of programming languages I am concentrating on [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript), [C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)), [Objective-C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C) and [Erlang](http://www.erlang.org). I love the web; therefore I am a great believer in [web standards](http://www.webstandards.org) and [responsive design](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design). I write here to learn and to share some hopefully relevant nuggets, unearthed by me or found somewhere else. If you should want to comment or to contact me,
I would feel flatteredâ€”please be invited to tweet [@michaelnisi](http://twitter.com/michaelnisi) or email <michael.nisi@gmail.com>.
