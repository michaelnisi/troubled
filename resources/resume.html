        <p>
        As an application developer, my objective is to build meaningful
        applications for end users, while enhancing software reliability and
        maintainability to create resilient distributed systemsâ€”from a file
        somewhere in a data center to the pixel on the glass in the userâ€™s
        hand. I have a high standard of quality, in coding and writing, and
        believe that developing software is communication, in the end itâ€™s
        about language.
        </p>

        <blockquote>Everything boils down to words.</blockquote>

        <p>
        I can lead and follow. As a leader I continuously ask myself how I
        might serve my followers. As a follower Iâ€™m likewise driven by a
        desire to be of use.

        <ul>
          <li>
            2019 - now Senior Software Engineer,
            <a href="https://apploft.de">apploft.</a>, Hamburg
            <p>
            At apploft. we build <a href="https://www.apploft.de/referenzen/">apps</a> for varied clients. Select iOS apps with substantial work by me are comdirect banking, Gerolsteiner TrinkCheck, and o2 Money & o2 Banking.</p>
            <p></p>
            While helping to maintain the comdirect banking app, Iâ€˜ve built a new home screen with an expandable accordion navigation that allows users to access all their accounts directly from the home screen. A huge refactoring was necessary to accomplish this.
            <p>
            I wrote the TrinkCheck hydration tracking apps for iOS and watchOS. Especially integration with Apple Health and synchronisation between phone and watch were fun challenges. I had to endure many workouts to ensure correct water demand computations.
            </p>
            <p>
            For o2 Money & o2 Banking I built the home and the housekeeping book screens. In this project hitting the tight schedule with a large team was a rich experience I donâ€˜t want to miss.
            </p>
            <p>Other apps Iâ€˜ve worked on are HiPP Baby App, HiPP BIO App, HiPP Kinder App, HEXAL Pollenflug, Kulturpunkte Hamburg and more.
            </p>

          <li>
            2015 - now Developer/Founder, Walsrode
            <p>
            I wrote
            <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/podest/id794983364"
               >Podest</a

             efficiency. Multilevel caching is hard to implement, but it makes
             searching and browsing a snappy and unintrusive experience.
            </p>

              <p>
              Shipping an app of this complexity solo has been challengingâ€”it
              taught me to prioritize. Picking up
              <a href="https://swift.org">Swift</a> along the way, a language in
              its infancy when I started, brought some growing pains, but
              overall sounds worse than it was. Switching back and forth between
              Swift and JavaScript has been proving itself fruitful.
              </p>
              <p>
              Remote caching is realized in
              <a href="https://nodejs.org">Node.js</a> running in

            London/Hamburg/Vienna

            <p>
            Starting with a distributed team of five, for CMC, we brought
            their spread betting platform to the web. With the team growing to
            around 50 people, we built a rich, modular Adobe Flash
            application. I was responsible for the product library and the
            trading ticket of the Flash client. This integral role allowed me
            to catalyse and harmonize team communication between groups.

            Bassier, Bergmann &amp; Kindler; Kuborgh, and more

            <p>
            In the heyday of Adobe Flash, we developed product sites, games,
            and bannersâ€”selling anything from packet soup to luxury cars.
            Memorable is the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, for which I built
            a stylable betting game with DRID, which was sold to multiple
            clients.

        <h2>Education</h2>
        Not exactly a role model regarding formal education, being an art school
        dropout, Iâ€™ve learned most things I know autodidactically by practice. I
        wrote my first line of JavaScript in 1996. Learning never ends.

              non-renewing StoreKit subscriptions â€“ iOS
              <p>
              Mobile apps are notoriously hard to test, naturally safe code is
              essential. With Swiftâ€™s type system we can construct compelling
              data structures, leveraging the compiler for correctness of our
              code. In the in-app store of Podest, I use a finite-state machine
              with enumerated type-safe states and events. A common pattern in
              my code, I have learned to appreciate through
              <a href="http://erlang.org/doc/man/gen_statem.html">OTP</a>.

            After <a href="https://github.com/michaelnisi/pickup">pickup</a>,
            the Node.js streaming parser Iâ€™ve written for Podest, I needed
            comparison. Feeder is a good example for using xmerl_sax_parser,
            the OTP SAX parser API, and seems to resonate with the Elixir
            community. Memory characteristics of the BEAM bring Node to shame,
            but thatâ€™s comparing apples and oranges.

            Caching podcast feed proxy â€“ Node
            <p>
            Podestâ€™s feed proxy is tailor-made, not depending on any specific
            HTTP framework. Its requirements, high volume and small memory
            footprint, demand efficient inbound and outbound data-flow. This
            has been realized using Nodeâ€™s standard HTTP interfaces and

            SQLite â€“ iOS
            <p>
            Apple uses SQLite in most of their apps on macOS and iOS. Being
            the de facto standard database on Apple devices, packages for
            using it are plenty. For me, these dependencies are often too
            thick. Thatâ€™s why I wrote Skull, a thin layer of Swift, barely
            covering the C library. I like simple things, software development
            is hard enough.

            about HTTP by reading Mark Cavageâ€™s code. Iâ€™m hoping to find time
