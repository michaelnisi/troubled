        <p>
        As an application developer, my objective is to build meaningful applications for end users, while enhancing software reliability and maintainability to create resilient distributed systemsâ€”from a file somewhere in a data center to the pixel on the glass in the userâ€™s hand. I have a high standard of quality, in coding and writing, and believe that developing software is communication, in the end itâ€™s about language.

        <blockquote>Everything boils down to words.</blockquote>

        <p>I can lead and follow. As a leader I continuously ask myself how I might serve my followers. As a follower Iâ€™m likewise driven by a desire to be of use.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            2015 - 2019 Developer/Founder, Walsrode
            <p>
            I wrote <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/podest/id794983364">Podest</a>, a modest podcast client for iOS, focusing on performance and efficiency. Multilevel caching is hard to implement, but it makes searching and browsing a snappy and unintrusive experience.
            </p>

            <p>Shipping an app of this complexity solo has been challengingâ€”it taught me to prioritize.
            Picking up <a href="https://swift.org">Swift</a> along the way, a language in its infancy when I started, brought some growing pains, but overall sounds worse than it was. Switching back and forth between Swift and JavaScript has been proving itself fruitful.
            </p>
            <p>
            Remote caching is realized in <a href="https://nodejs.org">Node.js</a>, deployed to Joyent <a href="https://www.joyent.com/smartos">SmartOS</a> instances. These backends are fronted by <a href="https://haproxy.com">HAProxy</a>, running on <a href="https://alpinelinux.org">Alpine Linux</a>, with <a href="http://feurix.org/projects/hatop/">HATop</a> for monitoring. All APIs are designed for good CDN caching ratios, I use <a href="https://www.fastly.com">Fastly</a>.

            <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/michaelnisi/podest/tree/master/Podest/sync">Sync</a> between devices is implemented using <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/cloudkit">CloudKit</a>, maybe my favorite Apple API.

          <li>
            2008 - 2012 Developer, <a href="https://www.cmcmarkets.com">CMC Markets</a>, London/Hamburg/Vienna

            <p>
            Starting with a distributed team of five, for CMC, we brought their spread betting platform to the web. With the team growing to around 50 people, we built a rich, modular Adobe Flash application. I was responsible for the product library and the trading ticket of the Flash client. This integral role allowed me to catalyse and harmonize team communication between groups.

          <li>2002 - 2008 Consulting, <a href="https://www.drid.de">DRID</a>, Bassier, Bergmann &amp; Kindler; Kuborgh, and more

            <p>
            In the heyday of Adobe Flash, we developed product sites, games, and banners, selling everything between packet soup to luxory cars. Memorable is the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, for which I built a stylable betting game with DRID, which was sold to multiple clients.

        <h2>Education</h2>
        Not exactly a role model regarding formal education, being an art school dropout, Iâ€™ve learned most things I know autodidactly by practice. I wrote my first line of JavaScript in 1996. Learning never ends.

            <a href="https://github.com/michaelnisi/skull">Skull</a> Swift SQLite â€“ iOS
            <p>
              Apple uses SQLite in most applications on macOS and iOS. Being the defacto standard database on Apple devices, there are many ways to use it, from CoreData to SQLite.swift. But for me, these dependencies are often too heavy. For that reason I wrote Skull, just one thin layer of Swift, barely covering the C library. I like simple things. Software development is difficult enough.

        <h2>Other Interests and Activities</h2>
        <p>
        The older I get, the more of a fitness nut I becomeâ€”standing desk and all. I love surfing, swimming, and running. I eat well, like to read actual books, and take walks.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>2012 - 2016 Surfing, Atlantic, Europe
            <li>1993 - 1994 Competitive windsurfer, Deutscher Windsurf Cup</li>

            <li>1978 - 1989 Handball, TSV Denkendorf</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        Further windsurfing travels, more work at the plant, delivering parcels as a courier driver, and building exhibition stands across Europeâ€”aquiring skills handy to this day.
