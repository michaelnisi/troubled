        <p>
        As an application developer, my objective is to build meaningful applications for end users, while enhancing software reliability and maintainability to create resilient distributed systemsâ€”from a file somewhere in a data center to the pixel on the glass in the userâ€™s hand. I have a high standard of quality, in coding and writing, and believe that developing software is communication, in the end itâ€™s about language.
        </p>

        <blockquote>Everything boils down to words.</blockquote>

        <p>I can lead and follow. As a leader I continuously ask myself how I might serve my followers. As a follower Iâ€™m likewise driven by a desire to be of use.</p>

        <p>First and foremost, I love coding.</p>

        <h2>Work History</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            2015 - 2019 Developer/Founder, Walsrode
            <p>
            I wrote <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/podest/id794983364">Podest</a>, a modest podcast app for iOS, focusing on performance and efficiency. Multilevel caching is hard to implement, but it makes searching and browsing a snappy and unintrusive experience.
            </p>

            <p>Shipping an app of this complexity solo has been challengingâ€”it taught me to prioritize.
            Picking up <a href="https://swift.org">Swift</a> along the way, a language in its infancy when I started, brought some growing pains, but overall sounds worse than it was. Switching back and forth between Swift and JavaScript has been proving itself fruitful.
            </p>
            <p>
            Remote caching is realized in <a href="https://nodejs.org">Node.js</a>, deployed to Joyent <a href="https://www.joyent.com/smartos">SmartOS</a> instances. These backends are fronted by <a href="https://haproxy.com">HAProxy</a>, running on <a href="https://alpinelinux.org">Alpine Linux</a>, with <a href="http://feurix.org/projects/hatop/">HATop</a> for monitoring. All APIs are designed for good CDN caching ratios, I use <a href="https://www.fastly.com">Fastly</a>.

            <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/michaelnisi/podest/tree/master/Podest/sync">Sync</a> between devices is implemented using <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/cloudkit">CloudKit</a>, maybe my favorite Apple API.

            2008 - 2012 Developer, <a href="https://www.cmcmarkets.com">CMC Markets</a>, London/Hamburg/Vienna

            <p>
            Starting with a distributed team of five, for CMC, we brought their spread betting platform to the web. With the team growing to around 50 people, we built a rich, modular Adobe Flash application. I was responsible for the product library and the trading ticket of the Flash client. This integral role allowed me to catalyse and harmonize team communication between groups.

          <li>2002 - 2008 Consulting, <a href="https://www.drid.de">DRID</a>, Bassier, Bergmann &amp; Kindler; Kuborgh, and more

            <p>
            In the heyday of Adobe Flash, we developed product sites, games, and bannersâ€”selling anything from packet soup to luxury cars. Memorable is the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, for which I built a stylable betting game with DRID, which was sold to multiple clients.

        <h2>Education</h2>
        Not exactly a role model regarding formal education, being an art school dropout, Iâ€™ve learned most things I know autodidactically by practice. I wrote my first line of JavaScript in 1996. Learning never ends.

        <h2>Selected Open Source Contributions</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/michaelnisi/podest/tree/master/Podest/store">Podest/store</a> Podest IAPs â€“ iOS
            <p>
              Mobile apps are notoriously hard to test, naturally safe code is essential. Swiftâ€”statically typedâ€”enables us to design compelling data structures, leveraging the compiler for building up confidence in our code. In the in-app purchasing store of Podest, I use finite-state machines with enumerated states and events, a frequent pattern in my code.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li><a href="https://github.com/michaelnisi/feeder">feeder</a> Parse RSS and Atom feeds â€“ Erlang
            <p>After <a href="https://github.com/michaelnisi/pickup">pickup</a>, the Node.js streaming parser Iâ€™ve written for Podest, I wanted to have a comparison. Feeder is a good example for using xmerl_sax_parserâ€”the OTP SAX parserâ€”and seems to resonate with the Elixir community. Memory characteristics of the BEAM bring Node to shame, but thatâ€™s comparing apples and oranges.
            </p>

          <li><a href="https://github.com/michaelnisi/manger-http">manger-http</a> Caching podcast feed proxy â€“ Node
            <p>
              I enjoy building HTTP APIs, preferably without locking myself into some bloated framework.
            </p>
          <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/michaelnisi/skull">Skull</a> Swift SQLite â€“ iOS
            <p>
              Apple uses SQLite in most of their apps on macOS and iOS. Being the de facto standard database on Apple devices, packages for using it are plenty. For me, these dependencies are often too thick. Thatâ€™s why I wrote Skull, a thin layer of Swift, barely covering the C library. I like simple things, software development is hard enough.

          <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/kean/Nuke">Nuke</a> Caching image loader â€“ iOS
            <p>
            Nuke is the high performance image loaderâ€”written by Alexander Grebenyukâ€”I use in Podest for quick loading of arbitrary images over HTTP while scrolling. Iâ€™m happy, we were able to <a href="https://github.com/kean/Nuke/pull/190">resolve</a> this highly volatile <a href="https://github.com/kean/Nuke/issues/174">race condition</a>.

          <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/restify/node-restify">restify</a> Old school REST â€“ Node
            <p>Not quite the <a href="https://github.com/fastify/fastify">future</a> of REST development, but still dear to my heart. Iâ€™ve learned a lot about HTTP by reading Mark Cavageâ€™s code. Iâ€™m hoping to find time to follow through with this <a href="https://github.com/restify/clients/pull/198">PR</a>, enabling better streaming support for restify clients.</p>

        <h2>Other Interests and Activities</h2>
        <p>
        The older I get, the more of a fitness nut I becomeâ€”standing desk and all. I love surfing, swimming, and running. I eat well, like to read actual books, and take walks.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>2012 - 2016 Surfing, Atlantic, Europe
            <li>1993 - 1994 Competitive windsurfer, Deutscher Windsurf Cup</li>
            <li>1992 - 1993 Windsurfing, Maui, Hawaii</li>
            <li>1991 - 1992 Worker, cylinder block casting, Mercedes-Benz plant, UntertÃ¼rkheim</li>
            <li>1990 - 1991 Paratrooper, military service, Luftlandebrigade 25</li>
            <li>1978 - 1989 Handball, TSV Denkendorf</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        Further windsurfing travels, more work at the plant, delivering parcels as a courier driver, and building exhibition stands across Europe, acquiring skills handy to this day.
