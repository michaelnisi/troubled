        <p>
        As an application developer, my objective is to build meaningful mobile applications for end users, while enhancing software reliability and maintainability to create resilient distributed systems, from a file somewhere in a data center to the pixel on the glass in the user’s hand. I have a high standard of quality, in coding and writing, and believe that developing software is communication, in the end it’s about language.

        <h2><a name="oss">Selected Open Source Contributions</a></h2>
        I love open source software. Find more of my contributions on <a href="https://github.com/michaelnisi">GitHub</a>—mostly <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node</a>, <a href="https://swift.org">Swift</a>, and <a href="http://www.erlang.org">Erlang</a>. I seem to have a weak spot for streaming text parsers and HTTP.

            <h3>Podest Podcast App</h3>
            2015 - 2018 Developer/Founder, Walsrode
            <p>
            I wrote <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/podest/id794983364">Podest</a>, a modest podcast client for iOS, focusing on performance and efficiency. Caching data remotely and locally makes searching and browsing a snappy and unintrusive experience. Podest’s minimalist user interface sets the stage for awesome podcasts. Building an app of this complexity alone and shipping it has been challenging. Picking up <a href="https://swift.org">Swift</a> along the way, a language in the making, sounds harder than it was. The cognitive interplay between writing JavaScript—I use <a href="https://nodejs.org">Node</a> for centralized feed parsing and caching—and Swift proved itself as surprisingly fruitful.

            2008 - 2011 Developer, <a href="https://www.cmcmarkets.com">CMC Markets</a>, London

            <p>
            Starting with a distributed team of five, for CMC, we brought their spread betting platform to the web. With the team growing to around 50 people, we built a rich, modular Adobe Flash application. I was responsible for the product library and the trading ticket of the Flash client. This integral role allowed me to catalyse and harmonize team communication between groups.

          <li>2002 - 2008 Consulting, <a href="https://www.drid.de">DRID</a>, Bassier, Bergmann &amp; Kindler; Kuborgh, and more

          <p>
            In the heyday of Adobe Flash, we developed product sites, games, and banners, selling everything between packet soup to luxory cars. Memorable is the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, for which I built a stylable betting game with DRID, which was sold to multiple clients.

        <h2><a name="education">Education</a></h2>
        Not exactly a role model regarding formal education, being an art school dropout, I’ve learned most things I know autodidactly by practice. Learning never ends.
        <ul>
          <li>1994 - 1996 Alsterdamm – School of Visual Arts, Hamburg</li>

        <h2><a name="other">Other Interests and Activities</a></h2>
        <p>
        The older I get, the more of a fitness nut I become—standing desk and all. I love surfing, swimming, and running. I eat well, read books, and take walks.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>2012 - 2014 Surfing, Algarve, Portugal
          <li>1993 - 1994 Competitive Windsurfer, Deutscher Windsurf Cup</li>
          <li>1992 - 1993 Windsurfing, Maui, Hawaii</li>
          <li>1991 - 1992 Steel Foundry Worker, Daimler AG, Stuttgart</li>
          <li>1990 - 1991 Paratrooper, Military Service, Luftlandebrigade 25</li>
          <li>1978 - 1989 Handball, TSV Denkendorf</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        Further windsurfing travels were financed by more work at the foundry, delivering parcels as a courier driver, and building exhibition stands across Europe—aquiring skills handy to this day.
