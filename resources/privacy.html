        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <h3>Michael Nisi’s Privacy Policy was updated on May 25, 2018</h3>
        <p>
        Your privacy is as important to me as my own. I’m a person who writes Software, I neither have means nor interest to store huge amounts of data. Thus, the software I build is designed to collect as little data as possible. I’m committed to keeping your personal information safe. OK, that last sentence is Apple’s, I don’t store personal information, they do that for me. I rely on Apple’s strict policies.
        </p>

        <p>
        Building iOS apps, I don’t require personal information or logins, using iCloud I can build personalized apps without knowing a thing about my users. Apple’s iCloud handles authentication for me.

        <h2><a name="app">Application Data</a></h2>
        <p>
        Application data, like the content of the queue in a podcast app, for example, is also stored, and synced across devices, using iCloud. Again, no personal information is accessible to me.
